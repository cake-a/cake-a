## Salutations! I go by Keyka.

😄 Pronouns: She/Her/Hers

🌱 I’m currently learning to become a Full-Stack Developer via Codecademy. I'm have covered Web Development Foundations, and will soon begin learning Javascript.

📚 I’m currently working on a website called Comrade, which is a compilation of course pathways, booklists, reading guides, and notes for every major offered at colleges and universities within the United States. The hope is that this will help prospecting students increase their chance of success in higher education, as well as allow current students to broaden their knowledge via exploring other majors from other schools.

💭 I like thinking about the thread that can bring people together, and often explore rabbit holes pertaining to philosophy, religion, politics, and mental health.
